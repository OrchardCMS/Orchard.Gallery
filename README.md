# Orchard.Gallery

The module contains all the code necessary to run a modules gallery for Orchard as seen on https://gallery.orchardproject.net

To setup a gallery:
 - Download the module without enabling its feature
 - In the Recipes tab of the Modules admin page, run the Gallery recipe

It will create the necessary content types and taxonomies. You can then browse the gallery urls or add packages and versions.

# Theming

The module works better when you use its custom theme which is on https://github.com/OrchardCMS/TheGalleryMachine.
This theme is a child theme of https://github.com/OrchardCMS/TheBootstrapMachine so it will be required too.
